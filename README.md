# Journal script
This repository contains `journal.sh`, a shell script that can be used to easily keep a journal in Markdown.

When you run `journal.sh`, a Markdown editor will open with the current time and date, allowing you to immediately
begin writing. All journal entries will be aggregated at a main file that you specify.

By default, this script requires you to download the Markdown editor Remarkable, though this can be easily modified.

**Note**: your most recent entry will not be appended to your main journal file until you write your next entry.

## Keyboard shortcut
I recommend connecting a keyboard shortcut to `bash /path/to/journal.sh` to make it even easier to write a journal entry.
